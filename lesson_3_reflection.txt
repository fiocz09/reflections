When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository, when I want to share it with others, co-
    edit it with others, or just keep it on the cloud so that I can reach it
    from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git track my changes automatically, conflicts can be easily introduced.
    With manually push/pull, I can make sure things updated at right time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are different versions of file on your local device;
    Clones are copies from local or online file;
    Forks are copies just from online file.
    They are used in different occasions, so I guess I won't mess.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In case of multiple person working together with one project, you may have
    to know the changes made by others. Having a last known copy locally can
    avoid lots of conflict.
